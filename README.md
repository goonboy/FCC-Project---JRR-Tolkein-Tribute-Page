# FCC-Project---JRR-Tolkein-Tribute-Page
Free Code Camp basic front end web development project 

Tech used:  HTML, Bootstrap, CSS

My first project for the front end web development certifcate program for Free Code Camp.

Without looking at the example project's code, the goal was to build a similar tribute page on someone you admire.  The example was a tribute of Dr. Norman Borlaug, a scientist who's innovations in agriculture helped save a billion lives.  I choose JRR Tolkien because I consider him to be the master and forefather of the fantasy genre and author of some of the greatest classical fantasy novels of ever written.

I was first introduced to his work as a ten year old boy when my grade four teach read the predecessor to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit, to our class.  Shortly thereafter, I was introduced to a game called 'Dungeons and Dragons' which was inspired by the world that Tolkien created - Middle Earth.  Since then, my fascination and love for that genre has never ceased and I thoroughly enjoyed the films that were made on Tolkien's stories and rank as some of my most favourite movies of all time.

Master Tolkien was not only a brilliant mind and a pacifist, but a deeply religious man, who witnessed the horrors of World War I and penned the story of mankind and the universal struggle of good vs evil in the most epic manner that none will ever match.  

Master Tolkien is one of the greatest fiction writers of all time!
